# JSRbot Description
University of Toronto Robotics Association 2024 Hackathon Autonomous Vehicle Challenge

# 1. Software
## 1.1 Challenge 1 and 2: Line Following
### 1.1.1 Challenges
#### Basic Line following
This challenge will demonstrate that the team has properly assembled their robot and that their robot can follow a 1” black line on the ground. The team’s robot must automatically drive through a simple track while staying on the line. There will be 2 sections: a straight line segment and a gentle turn.
#### Advanced Line following
In this challenge, the team’s robot must follow a black line in a complex path on the ground. There will be sharp turns and loops that the robot must traverse.

### 1.1.2 Code explanation
Given 2 sensors, we made sure to not only follow the line but code for sharp turns and curves. 
#### Method 1

#### Method 2

## 1.2 Challenge 3: 
### Description
#### 1.2.1 Obstacle Detection
The team’s robot must detect and avoid obstacles in this course. Black lines will be placed to help guide the robots however they are still expected to detect and avoid on their own.
